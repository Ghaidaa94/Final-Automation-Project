# Final-Automation-Project
For my final automation project, I tested the website: https://automationexercise.com/ where I applied many of the skills I acquired in automation testing I developed a testing framework, created page objects, and crafted necessary TestCases for the project. This experience allowed to put my knowledge into practice and further enhance my expertise.
